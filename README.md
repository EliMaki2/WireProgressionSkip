# WireProgressionSkip
A terraria mod I am working on to make wire more accessible and useful for harder mods or challenges (looking at you eternity mode).
I plan to add a new NPC that can move in as soon as a player gets any trap from natural spawns. They at first only sell wire to be used as crafting materials but quite expensively. After beating King Slime they sell the most basic wire tools to allow people to start experimenting. After beating Eye of Cuthulu they sell acuators and pressure plates, allowing pit traps and such. After beating Deerclops they sell Grates and Pumps along with a pipe tool that allows people to not cross wires with pump wires. After Queen Bee they sell logic gates. After Skeletron they sell Sensors, and a enemy sensor that can work through blocks. After either Evil boss they sell stone versions of the traps found in the jungle temple. After Wall of Flesh they sell the jungle temple traps, and after Moon Lord they sell upgraded lunar traps.
